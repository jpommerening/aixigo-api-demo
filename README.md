# aixigo-api-demo
aixigo Wealth Management API demo with Vue.js and D3.js

## Usage

Install dependencies & build toolchain:

```console
yarn install
```

Build and save a JS bundle in `dist/main.js`:

```console
yarn build
```

Start a live-reloading webserver:

```console
yarn start
```

(Note: you might also be able to use `npm` instead of `yarn`)

## Setup

The service hostname is configured in `src/index.js` (you'll probably see it right away).

If you want to try some different API parameters, you can edit them in `src/api.js`.
